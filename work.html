            For this position, I would look at incoming tickets from clients who were having issue with the software.
            I would then try to replicate the issue they were having and reach out to them with an update
            that I was looking into the issue.

            Take incoming calls from clients who wanted to learn how to access a certain function of the software
            or if they were having issues with it. Some clients would also call in if they needed to update their
            software version. I would then remotely access their server and update the softare for them.

          <p>
            I have had multiple jobs as a mechanic over the years. I would do anything from maintenance, to electrical
            to suspension work, and so on.

          <h2>Drain Cleaner/Plumbing</h2>
          <p>
            I have also worked for a few plumbing companies as a drain cleaner and some plumbing repairs.
            I would mostly go to customer's homes who had a clogged drain and I would clear it.
            There were also times where I would replace garbage disposals, faucets, water heaters, and other items.
